# Python

After learning Java and C at University I've taken interest in learning Python. All my code for studying Python will be shared in this repository!

Every program can be run with the following command assuming Python is installed on the system:
```python
py Filename.py
```

I like the course path, but it lacks depth and some crucial use cases are not shown, just to name some things that I noticed. I added a lot more depth, details and explanations than the course offers to my code -> for future uses for myself and for anyone that would like to learn just from reading the code itself.
